# FIRSTHOMEWORK

What was done:
1. Created repository on Git Hub
2. Project created with ng-cli
3. Figured out how the build process works. Tried build for production and dev. Checked out webpack-config.json
4. Set up the tsLint according to my preferences
5. Wrapped my head around the mock up page. Figured out how to split it to small pieces
6. Created components using "ng g" command (pages, courses, course, login)
